              Giant pandas are very
              <a href="#" class="active-color">unusual animals</a> that eat
              almost exclusively <a href="#" class="active-color">bamboo</a>,
              which is very low in nutrients. Because of this, they have many
              unique adaptations for their low-energy lifestyle. Giant pandas
              are solitary, with males and females coming together only briefly
              to mate. Habitat loss is the primary threat to this species. Its
              popularity around the world has helped the giant panda become the
              focus of successful conservation programs.

            <p class="">
              Giant pandas are bears and are members of the
              <a href="#" class="active-color">Order Carnivora</a>. They are
              unique because, although they evolved among the mostly carnivorous
              bear species of the world, their diet is vegetarian. Despite the
              availability of other plants, they feed almost exclusively on
              bamboo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Giant pandas communicate with one another in dense bamboo forests
              primarily by scent. Males regularly scent-mark the margins of
              their territories by adopting a “headstand” position to mark a
              bamboo stalk with their anogenital glands.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="description-item">
            <h3 class="sub-title">Physical features and characteristics::</h3>
            <p class="">
              The low nutrient value of bamboo figures prominently in the
              biology of the giant panda. They have extremely powerful jaws and
              associated muscles to crunch through the woody stems of bamboo.
              Each hand bears a
              <a href="#" class="active-color">specialized metacarpal bone</a>
              in the wrist that functions as a thumb would in humans, to allow
              them to grasp the circular bamboo stalks. While other herbivorous
              animals, such as antelope, zebras, or rabbits, have very long
              digestive tracts, the giant panda retains an essentially bear-like
              digestive tract. Thus, the digestive efficiency of the bamboo they
              consume is quite low. Examination of the feces demonstrates that
              their food has been only partially digested. The low nutrient
              value of their food and their low digestive efficiency results in
              an animal that is constrained to a low-metabolism. This lifestyle
              explains why giant pandas sleep so often and why they eat such
              <a href="#" class="active-color">normous</a> amounts of bamboo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Individuals do not travel long distances, and males will establish
              territories that are not particularly large compared with other
              species in the Order Carnivora. Adult females average about 230
              pounds in weight, with males sometimes reaching 350 pounds. Their
              hair is very dense, conserving their body heat in their cold
              habitats. Their iconic coloration remains a mystery to scientists
              but may aid with camouflage.

          <div class="description-item">
            <h3 class="sub-title">Lifestyle and reproduction:</h3>
            <p class="">
              Females are fertile for only a very short period of time and
              exhibit delayed implantation. Although twins are not unusual, a
              mother will typically only rear one cub. Adults are solitary, with
              mating pairings being quite brief. The tiny cubs are altricial, or
              not born in an advanced state of development, and are completely
              helpless, blind and deaf, and without the fur
              <a href="#" class="active-color">necessary</a> to regulate their
              own body temperatures. As a result, maternal care is extensive.
              Cubs do not begin eating bamboo until they are around a year old.
            </p>
            <p>
              When twins are born in zoos, extraordinary measures are taken to
              train the female to accept swapping of her cubs regularly 24 hours
              a day, so that she only cares for one a time, but that both
              receive adequate care.

              Their preferred cool and wet bamboo forests are found at
              <a href="#" class="active-color">elevations</a> between 5,000 and
              10,000 feet. Cubs are raised in rocky crevices, dead trees, or

              Our animal care professionals offer each adult or subadult giant
              panda about 80 pounds of various bamboo species per day, and they
              generally select and consume only about third of that. They also
              are offered nutritious
